// Token Creation Contract
#![no_std]
use soroban_sdk::{contract, contractimpl, Address, Env, String, Symbol};

#[contract]
pub struct TokenFactory;

#[contractimpl]
impl TokenFactory {
    pub fn create_memecoin(
        env: Env,
        creator: Address,
        name: String,
        symbol: Symbol,
        initial_supply: u64,
        metadata_uri: String,
    ) -> Address {
        // Token creation logic
    }
    
    pub fn mint_post_nft(
        env: Env,
        creator: Address,
        post_content_hash: String,

### Targeting Indian Population (with Global Scale Secondary)
**Implications:**
- Prioritize on/off-ramp services and KYC/KYB providers with strong Indian support.
- UI/UX: English-first, but plan for Hindi/regional language packs post-MVP.
- Compliance: Stay aware of Indian crypto regulations (especially RBI, FIU-IND updates).
- Infrastructure: Host backend and database on AWS Mumbai/Azure India for lowest latency.
- Marketing: Focus on YouTube, Telegram, and WhatsApp-based outreach for India.

**In MVP Implementation:**
- During on/off ramp integration, prioritize services like Transak or Ramp Network that support INR and have a track record in India.
- Make geo-aware features (e.g., SMS OTP for Indian numbers) part of onboarding.

### Revenue Model: Middle Layer Fees on All Transactions
**Design & Implementation:**
- Abstract fee-taking into a single middleware/service in the backend and smart contract.
- In Soroban contracts, all token swaps, NFT orders, and payment flows should deduct a platform fee automatically and send it to a configurable platform account.
- Clearly communicate all fees in UI at transaction confirmation.
- Analytics: Track all platform-collected fees per feature to optimize pricing post-MVP.

**MVP Focus:**
- Simple, flat % fee per transaction (configurable via admin panel), no complex tiering or dynamic fees for MVP.
- Collect and store fee revenue data per user and per feature for future insights.

### Users Must Create New Stellar Wallets
**Implementation:**
- Onboarding flow must default to new wallet creation (using Stellar SDK); do not allow importing existing wallets during MVP.
- Users receive mnemonic/secret with strong warnings and copy backup flows.
- Consider gamified onboarding (e.g., “Welcome to Stellar” popup, first tiny XLM airdrop for fuel).
- Store only encrypted public wallet addresses with strong disclaimers that private keys/mnemonics are never stored by platform.

**Security:**
- Use secure random generators for keypair.
- Step-by-step guidance for users to save and understand mnemonics.
- Consider “educational modal” about using Stellar, why you’re taking this road (vs. MetaMask, Phantom, etc.)

### Tighter, India-Aware Content Moderation
**Implementation:**
- Use a slightly stricter content policy than X (e.g., a “yellow” warning for borderline content, immediate takedown for regulatory no-go’s: hate speech, pornography, scams, etc.).
- Use rule-based filtering at post submission (for MVP: regex and keyword lists, potential integration with fast local ML models post-MVP).
- Integrate reporting workflow: any user can report a post, simple admin review dashboard for MVP (no appeals, just removal).
- Consider a basic user-blocking/muting feature for toxic actors.

**MVP Only:**
- Manual approval for flagged content (to avoid AI overhead), scalable to automation later.
- Sample TOS/Community Guidelines text, FAQ on what’s not allowed, shown at onboarding.

### Simple MVP Features, No Complex Tokenomics
**Implementation:**
- All memecoins = standard Soroban fungible token (name, symbol, fixed supply).
- No vesting, bonding curves, creator locks, or governance yet.
- NFT = 1-to-1 mapping: each post is a unique token, metadata = IPFS content and post hash.
- DEX interface: simple swaps, no liquidity pools or AMM curves for MVP.

**Revised MVP Deliverables with Your Constraints**
🔑 Core Features
- Stellar wallet auto-generated for all users
- Clean, minimal onboarding explaining wallet, mnemonics, and basic KYC (if needed for FIAT ramps)
- Social feed: minimal, like X, filters, basic media support, report & removal system
- Easy memecoin creation: form with name, symbol, supply, confirms with fee breakdown
- NFT minting: each post can be minted as NFT for small fee
- Simple DEX integration: trade any memecoin for XLM, all fees routed to platform treasury
- On/off ramp: integrates with INR-friendly third party with KYC scaffold

📚 Additional Implementation Notes
- Frontend: Add FAQ pages especially for new-to-Stellar users and explainer modal for wallet management.
- Backend: Fee middleware (Express) plus contract function for collecting fees at transaction time.
- Moderation:
  - Add moderator interface for reviewing flagged posts.
  - Keyword-based filters per India’s regulatory hot topics (periodically updated).
- Analytics:
  - Dashboard for tracking platform fee revenue
  - Post/content flags and removals

📋 Tasks for Your Team
**Day 1-2:**
- Finalize backend infra region (AWS Mumbai, etc.)
- Prepare onboarding copy (in English, but design for i18n)

**Days 3-7:**
- Prioritize wallet generation and storage flows
- Build moderation scaffolding

**Days 8-14:**
- Plug in INR-friendly on/off ramps
- Enforce fee deduction system
- Final QA with focus on fee transparency and clear content policy in the UI

💡 Final Notes & Recommendations
- Explain your rationale: Make it clear (in copy) why users get a Stellar wallet and how it benefits them (instant/cheap transfers, etc.).
- Flag Indian compliance: Consult quickly with a local legal expert for wording and data storage requirements.
- Keep it simple: Only add as much complexity as is unavoidable for user safety, regulatory compliance, and basic business viability.
- If you have more specific requirements about moderation workflows, fee percentages, or preferred on/off-ramp partners, let me know and I will further refine the technical specs and timelines!
